```
from flask import Flask
from . kraken_data import getTickerInfo
```
The code imports the Flask module, which is necessary for building web applications using Flask.
It also imports the getTickerInfo function from the kraken_data module.

```
app = Flask(__name__)
```
Creates an instance of the Flask class and assigns it to the variable app.
__name__ is a special Python variable that represents the name of the current module.

```
ticker_symbol = 'XBTUSD'
long_symbol = 'XXBTZUSD'
```
Sets the values of ticker_symbol and long_symbol to specific cryptocurrency symbols used for obtaining data.

```
def last_close_price():
    ticker = getTickerInfo(ticker_symbol)
    last_trade_closed = ticker[long_symbol]['c']
    content = "Last Trade Closed Price: " + str(last_trade_closed[0])
    return content
```
Defines the last_close_price() function.
It calls the getTickerInfo() function with ticker_symbol as an argument to retrieve ticker information.
It extracts the last trade closed price from the retrieved data using long_symbol as the key.
The price is converted to a string and concatenated with a text message.
The final content is returned from the function.

```
def last_ask_price():
    ticker = getTickerInfo(ticker_symbol)
    last_ask = ticker[long_symbol]['a']
    content = "Last Ask Price: " + str(last_ask[0])
    return content
```
Defines the last_ask_price() function.
It retrieves ticker information using the getTickerInfo() function.
The last ask price is extracted from the data using long_symbol as the key.
The price is converted to a string and combined with a message.
The final content is returned.

```
@app.route('/')
def home():
    return last_ask_price()
```
Decorates the home() function with @app.route('/'), which specifies that the function should be executed when the root route ("/") is accessed.
The function simply returns the result of the last_ask_price() function.

```
@app.route('/about')
def about():
    return 'About'
```

Decorates the about() function with @app.route('/about'), specifying that the function should be executed when the "/about" route is accessed. The function returns the string "About".

The above code creates a Flask web application with two routes: the root route ("/") and the "/about" route. The root route displays the last ask price, while the "/about" route returns the string "About".
